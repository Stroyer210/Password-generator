## Description  :bookmark_tabs:

write description here

## Installation :computer:

write how to work the project
You are able to see my project in two different ways, depending on what you are looking for:

 1. If you only want to see my portfolio, you can go to this URL: https://stroyer210.github.io/Portfolio/
 2. If you want to see my code, you have my repository's folder on top, plus all the documents, such HTML, CSS and images.

## Usage :bar_chart:
If you are unable to open the URL, I attached a screenshot of it below:
    ![This is a screenshot of how the website looks on top.](Assets/Images/screenshot1.png)

As you can see, there is a little menu on the top-right of the website, so you can click any of them and it will take you to the respective section. If you go to my work, you can click on some of the projects I have done and it will take you to the deployed website, and also on the bottom you can find some links so you can contact me.

## Credits :email:

I am gonna list all the links I used to make this project really good.
