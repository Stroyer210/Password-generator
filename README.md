## Description  :bookmark_tabs:

This project was really good because it made me use a lot of JavaScript code that is really useful for any kind of project; code such "Functions", "for loop", etcetera. I knew it was a really important project so I spent a lot of time trying to understand what kinda of code to use and type until I finally found it, it really made me think but after I created a pseudo code, it was so much easier. 
The functionality of the application is to create a random password according to the items that we want; like uppercase, numbers, and whatnot. Finally, one of the things I learned was to actually create a pseudo code and work through it; after that the code doesn't seem that difficult.

## Installation :computer:

You are able to see the password generator in two different ways, depending on what you are looking for:

 1. If you only want to try the actual application, you can go to this URL: https://stroyer210.github.io/Password-generator/
 2. If you want to see my code, you have my repository's folder on top, plus all the documents, such HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Usage :bar_chart:
If you are unable to open the URL, I attached a screenshot of it below:

    ---
    ![This is a screenshot of how the finally result looks like.](assets/images/password3.png)

After you open the application, you will have to click the button that says "Generate Password", and then it is gonna ask you how long you want your password, then it is gonna ask you if you want uppercase, lowercase, numbers and symbols and finally it is gonna generate a random password with the group of characters that you asked for.
